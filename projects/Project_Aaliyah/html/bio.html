        Aaliyah Dana Haughton (/ɑːˈliːə/ ah-LEE-ə; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001), known as Aaliyah, was an
        American singer
        and actress. She has been credited with helping to redefine contemporary R&B, pop, and hip hop,[2] earning her
        the
        nicknames the "Princess of R&B" and "Queen of Urban Pop".

        Born in Brooklyn and raised in Detroit, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the
        television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed
        with Jive
        Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became
        her
        mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number (1994). The
        album
        sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry
        Association
        of America (RIAA). After allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and
        signed
        with Atlantic Records.

        Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, One in a Million (1996),
        which
        sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah
        made her
        acting debut in the film Romeo Must Die, alongside Jet Li. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which was
        supported
        by her single "Try Again". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely through airplay, becoming the first in
        the
        chart's history to do so. After completing the film, Aaliyah subsequently filmed her starring role in Queen of
        the
        Damned (which was released posthumously), and in July 2001, released her eponymous third album, which topped the
        Billboard 200. The album spawned the singles "We Need a Resolution", "Rock the Boat" and "More Than a Woman".

        On August 25, 2001, at the age of 22, Aaliyah was killed in an airplane accident in the Bahamas along with eight
        other
        people on board, when the overloaded aircraft she was traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff. The pilot was
        later
        found to have traces of cocaine and alcohol in his body and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for
        the
        flight. Aaliyah's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the aircraft's operator, which was settled out
        of court.
        In the decades following her death, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by
        several
        posthumous releases. She has sold 8.1 million albums in the US and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums
        worldwide.
        Billboard lists her as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most
        successful in
        history. Her accolades include three American Music Awards and two MTV VMAs, along with five Grammy Award
        nominations.
